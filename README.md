# FrequencyCalculator
A program that given a text containing different English letters and punctuation symbols,returns the most frequent letter found in the text.

The letter returned is always in lower case.
The program is not concerned about the text that is passed to it as this text may be in upper or lower case. 
It does not count punctuation symbols, digits and whitespaces 

It uses a Hashmap for efficiency, and is thus of O(n) complexity
